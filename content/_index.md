hi, i'm **jamie** (he/they)

i'm a 23 y/o philosophy master's student at the university of bristol & a project support officer within the nhs.
i'm also a trans advocate.

i split my time between these three worlds, but i'll always take up an opportunity to bring them together.
as such, my main academic interests are in philosophy of medicine and social epistemology.
i specifically focus on the idea of expertise, epistemic injustice, and linking this all to trans healthcare.

i also have academic interests in trans jewish studies, as i did my undergrad in philosophy and theology.

less formally, i'm into urbanism, weird films, interesting music, cooking, and ttrpgs.

this is my more 'professional' website, though i retain the right to be a little silly sometimes!
i'll be uploading my blog posts & any other writing onto here.

though i'm no good at computers, i also am interested by free and open-source software, and i find 'old internet' and old tech fascinating.
i have a 'silly' neocities-esque website which can be found [here](https://splung.neocities.org). no promises it's <abbr title="safe-for-work"> sfw </abbr> though!
<small> it's also made from scratch and i am not great at coding so it might not work 100% properly </small>
