this is my default lunchtime mealprep - it's super easy to do and very delicious!! full of fibre too, so even better!!

**ingredients:**
	- x1 pack tofoo branded seitan
	- x1 pack spanish style grains (merchant gourmet or lidl branded)
	- x1 bag of spinach
	- x3 salad tomatoes
	- a swig of diet cherry coke
	- msg
	- paprika
	- chipotle chilli powder
	- ground coriander

**method:**
	1. rip apart the seitan into rough chunks & fry in some oil till brown. make sure to move it around a lot - it's quite sticky!
	2. chop up the salad tomatoes & place into the pan to get mushy.
	3. pour in your cherry coke & let this evaporate.
	4. add in the spanish style grains, the msg, paprika, chipotle chilli powder, & ground coriander & mix together.
	5. add in the spinach & let it wilt. you might need to add in a splash of water to help this. make sure everything is mixed thoroughly.
	6. serve!
