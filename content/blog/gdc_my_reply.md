If you need to be brought up to speed, read [my complaint](https://jamologies.net/blog/gdc-complaint/) to the Northampton GIC, and [their response](https://jamologies.net/blog/gdc-response/)!

I finally got round to writing a response to Northampton's nothing-burger they sent me. Here it is:

Dear Northampton Gender Clinic,

Thank you for your response, though ultimately I am dissatisfied with the clinic's approach to the matter.

In your response, you stated that "complex medical jargon can be a significant barrier" to the informed consent process, and as such you "use simple, clear language when explaining these aspects of hormone therapy".
This is something I strongly agree with, and is exactly why the 'lump' terminology can be so harmful. Lump(y) has strong connotations with cancer, especially in the breast. The main NHS website has a page on '[breast lumps](https://www.nhs.uk/symptoms/breast-lump/)' that demonstrate this association.
I fail to see how the language used on your website is clear. Clear language would avoid such negatively charged terminology, as this can muddle communication efforts.

Your response continually affirms the need for simple, accessible, relevant language. But the language used on the website is anything but. Whilst I appreciate that clinics have discretion in the way that they communicate to service users, the terminology currently in use sticks out, and can cause real harm.
I once again urge the clinic to change the language on the website. Trans women's breasts do not become 'lumpy'. They become tender, and grow, the same as cisgender women. Changing this harmful language is imperative.

Best,
Jamie Jewkes
